/**
 * Retrieves a question based on its order or creates a risk assessment if no more questions are left.
 *
 * This function first checks if there are remaining questions to be answered by counting the total number of questions
 * and comparing the provided `order` with the count. If there are more questions, it fetches the question based on the
 * given order along with its associated answer format and category. If no questions are left to answer, it triggers the
 * creation of a risk assessment based on the patient's responses and then redirects to the patient's summary page.
 *
 * @param {number} order - The order number of the question to retrieve.
 * @param {string} patientId - The ID of the patient whose question is being fetched.
 * @returns {Promise<Object|Redirect>} A promise that resolves to:
 * - A question object if more questions are available. The object contains:
 *     - `answerFormat` (Object): The format of the answer for this question.
 *     - `category` (Object): The category to which the question belongs.
 * - A redirect to the patientâ€™s summary page if no questions are left.
 * @throws {Error} Throws an error if there is an issue fetching the question or creating the risk assessment.
